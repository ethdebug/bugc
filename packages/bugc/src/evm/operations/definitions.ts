/**
 * Complete EVM instruction set definitions with type-safe stack operations.
 *
 * This file provides factory functions for all EVM instructions, mapping each
 * opcode to a type-safe operation that correctly handles stack manipulation.
 * Instructions are organized by functionality and include:
 *
 * - Arithmetic operations (ADD, MUL, SUB, etc.)
 * - Comparison operations (LT, GT, EQ, etc.)
 * - Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
 * - Stack operations (POP, PUSH*, DUP*, SWAP*)
 * - Memory/Storage operations (MLOAD, SLOAD, etc.)
 * - Environment/blockchain data access
 * - Control flow operations (JUMP, JUMPI, etc.)
 * - System operations (CALL, CREATE, etc.)
 *
 * Each instruction is defined with precise stack consumption/production patterns
 * using semantic stack brands for type safety.
